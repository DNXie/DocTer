## Paper
DocTer: Documentation-Guided Fuzzing for Testing Deep Learning API Functions (ISSTA'22) 


## Tool
We release DocTer on the Docker Hub. The instructions are written in ([`./DocTer_instructions.md`]())



## Details

We share the following data:


- [The bug list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DgupQBMVpybHtyOhCO0fRb-oJDZbZSbo7H-AG36AE_c/edit?usp=sharing).

- Annotation details ([`./annotation_details`]()): including the annotated data of 30% of the parameters, the keywords we used for normalization (Section 2.2) and the full list of assumptions we made during annotation (Section 2.2)

- Constraints extracted ([`./constraints_extracted`]()): The extracted constraints for 2,415 APIs.


- The details of generality analysis among versions (Section 4.1) ([`./generality_among_versions.md`]())

- The extended results of the impact of fuzzerâ€™s nondeterminism (Section 4.3) ([`./fuzzer_nondeterminism.md`]())

- The break down of all analyzed APIs (Section 3) ([`./irrelevant_apis_break_down.md`]())
